# Getting-Cleaning-Data-CourseProject

Repo for the submission of the course project for the Johns Hopkins Getting and Cleaning Data course.

This repository hosts the R code and documentation files for the Data Science's track course "Getting and Cleaning data", available in coursera.


## Files

The code works when all the data is present in the same folder, un-compressed and without names altered.

codebook.md describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

runAnalysis.R contains all the code to perform the analyses described in the 5 steps

The output of the 5th step is called sensor_avg_by_act_sub.txt, and uploaded in the course project's form.
